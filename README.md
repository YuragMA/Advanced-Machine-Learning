To be able to train for predictive analysis, csv files containing datasets have been imported into each exercise that uses predictive analysis. 

LISTS OF LIBRARIES IMPORTED:

import pandas as pd - data manipulation and analysis


import numpy as np - provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt - static, animated, and interactive visualizations 


from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression - providing tools for various tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction


from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split - commonly used to split a dataset into training and testing subsets


from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error - It measures the average squared difference between the actual and predicted values.


import seaborn as sns - creating attractive and informative statistical graphics.
